# MyWeddingAssessment

Site Under Test: [www.mywedding.com](http://www.mywedding.com)

### Project Summmary

This project was created as part of a technical assessment for a Test Automation role for mywedding.com. The objective was to use Java and Selenium WebDriver to navigate through the website and assert:

* that certain elements were present
* that certain elements were not present
* that certain elements contained certain information/data

### Constraints and Conditions

* Used Firefox web browser only to expedite the development process
* Setup a Firefox profile to enable user shared location for mywedding.com
  - View [this post](http://stackoverflow.com/a/28390721) for setting up a Firefox profile on your local computer
  - The current test structure assumes a profile named "TestAutomation". You can change the anticipated profile name [on this line](https://github.com/wattersnathen/MyWeddingAssessment/blob/master/test/com/mywedding/basetest/BaseTestCase.java#L22)
